						<h1>Valorant</h1>
			<h3>What is Valorant?</h3>
		<p>Valorant is a first person shooter game with good graphics and fast pace combat. It is a 5v5 Attackers against Defenders. <br>Attackers have to plant a bomb called the Spike while defenders try to defuse it or finnsh off all of the attackers before they plant it. <br>There is a certain amount of time as to when to plant or defuse the bomb. <br>if the bomb goes off anybody in the radius will die but the next round will start soon.</p>

			<h3>Different Gamemodes</h3>
		<p>There are different Gamemodes in Valorant. One of which is called unrated and it is the "normal" game mode in which I had aleady explained. <br>Another is spke rush where all attackers get spike and try to plant it and defenders try to defuse it. <br>Also each round a specific gun is used by everyone so the game chooses the gun for you. <br>Third, there is something called deathatch where you buy any gun at anytime and first to 40 kills wins the match. <br>Then there is Escalation where it is basicly gun game and the same rules apply as it. Next game mode is replication, replicaion is where everybody is the same agent on the team. <br>For example one team could be full of jett and the other team could have killjoy which are two agents in Valorant.</p>

		<h3>All starter agent names, functions, and abiliities.</h3>
		<p>To start, Brimstone is a controller which means he controls different parts in a plan meaning he could use his smoke to block of enemies in certain spots to hlp the team. His abillities are smokes he can place down, stim beaon which makes you run faster and your bullets rapid fire, after that is a molotov (molly for short) he shoots a molly gun and it can bounce off walls to the ground the fire erupts from it. His ult (ultimate) is a big light beam that kills anybody inside. <br>Next is Phoenix, he is a duelist so he rushes into site (which is where you plant the bomb) and creates space for the team. His moveset consists of a flash to blind the enemies but if you played with a new Phoenix you would know he blinds allies too. He too has a molly but he creates fire so the fire essence is created from his hand. Next he has a fire wall that can curve if they make it curve but it heals you and deals damage to teamates and enemies and same with the molly. <br>Next is Sage she is a sentinel which means she whatches flanks and supports the team (flanks are when 4 people are distracting the team and 1 person comes and kills everyone for behind. Her movset has a heal which can heal allies and yourself, slow orb which she throws and it bounces of walls and slows enimies and allies. She also has a jade wall and it takes 6 knife hits to break. Her ult is a res (which means revive) and if someone dies she can bring them back to life. <br>Next is Sova, Sova is a initiator so he playes close corners.Sova has a recon dart and when he shoots it and he enemies are visible to the dart their location gets revealed he also has a shock dart which if he shoots it lets a small radius of shock energy to deal damage to anyone even yourself if your not careful. He also has a owl looking drone that can shoot a tracking dart. His ult is a bow and arrow and he shoots big beams of light that goes through walls and hits enemies dealing lots of damage but you only get 3 shots. <br>Lastly is Jett , Jett is a duelist that has 2 smokes and 2 updrafts which you can double jump with. She also has a dash so she can activate her wind and if you press the key again she dashes. Her ult ability is where she gets 5 knives and she can shoot them. 150 to the head (one shot with full sheilds) and in the body its 50 damage.</p>
